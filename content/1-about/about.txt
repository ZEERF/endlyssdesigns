I’m (link: https://twitter.com/endlyssdesigns text:  Alyssa Leverenz), a freelance brand strategist. What interests me the most is the grand purpose that leads branding campaigns. That is what I am here to help embrace for small businesses looking to achieve visibility, credibility and long-standing success. 

**ENDLYSS DESIGNS** is my freelance brand strategy consultancy. I work independently, partnering with startups and small businesses to provide the marketing support necessary to achieve long-term business goals.

My knack for communication arts began in 2007 while earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Graphic Design and Public Relations, followed by a Master of Arts degree in Strategic Communication and Leadership. That journey led me to cross paths with an exceptionally creative individual. (Fellow classmate then, husband/partner at (link: https://coupleofcreatives.com text: Couple of Creatives) now.)
