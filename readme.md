# Let's Build: A Consultancy Website

![Lets Build: A Consultancy Website](http://web-crunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Let-Build-A-Consultancy-Website-Feature.jpg)

A custom consultancy website for [Alyssa Leverenz](http://twitter.com/endlyssdesigns) of [Couple of Creatives](https://coupleofcreatives.com) and [Endlyss Designs](http://endlyssdesigns.com).

This design + build is part of a video series brought to you by [Web-Crunch](https://web-crunch.com) featuring Alyssa and Andy Leverenz. As a creative team, they work together to create a new side project for Alyssa from beginning to end. Starting from [part one](https://web-crunch.com/lets-build-consultancy-website-part-1/) they sit down to discover Alyssa's requirements and goals for the project. Andy collectively takes you through the entire life span of the client and designer relationship hoping to offer "real world" experience on a real life project. Along the way you'll see design, code, consultations, brainstorming sessions, interviews, and more.

### Built with Kirby

Kirby is a file-based CMS.
Easy to setup. Easy to use. Flexible as hell.

You can find the login for Kirby's admin interface at
http://yourdomain.com/panel. You will be guided through the signup
process for your first user, when you visit the panel
for the first time.

#### Installation

Kirby does not require a database, which makes it very easy to
install. Just copy Kirby's files to your server and visit the
URL for your website in the browser.

**Please check if the invisible .htaccess file has been
copied to your server correctly**
